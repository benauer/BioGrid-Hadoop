Biogrid-Hadoop
==============
####Apache Hadoop MapReduce project for biological interaction datasets
<br>
&nbsp;To use this tool, you need a correctly configured Hadoop environment. In my case, the version is 1.2.1. The goal of this project is to query biological interactions in a fast way and also to demonstrate the "power of Hadoop". <br>
<br>
Firstly, you should create a text file with genes like this: <br><i>input.txt : </i>
<pre>
<code>CG13321
CG13322
CG13326
CG14247
Glycogenin
CG11796
CG12582</code>
</pre>
Then you need to run <i>start.py</i> and follow the instructions inside the program. (You also need to install easygui to use this tool.)

<i>Tested with python2 and Apache Hadoop version 1.2.1.</i>
